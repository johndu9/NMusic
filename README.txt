This is a simple library I made to help me compute frequencies and chords for my Arduino projects. I've documented all of it and added some examples so everyone can use the library! Keep in mind this only does simple calculations.

Just a quick note: the examples use pin 8 as the speaker pin.

Happy sound tinkering!
